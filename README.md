# Icon Generator SaaS App

This README provides an overview of the Icon Generator SaaS (Software as a Service) application that I have built. The app utilizes the DALL-E API for generating icons, Stripe for payment processing, and leverages technologies such as React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Amazon S3 for image storage.

The Icon Generator SaaS application is a project I've developed to allow users to create icons with ease using the powerful DALL-E API. Users can access the icon generation service by making secure payments through Stripe. The application is divided into a frontend, created with React and bundled with Vite, and a backend built with Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and S3 for image storage.
