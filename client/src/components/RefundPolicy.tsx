        IconizeAI ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to providing a positive
        user experience. This Refund Policy outlines the conditions under which
        refunds may be considered for purchases made through the IconizeAI
        website. 1. Refund Eligibility Criteria: a. No Refunds for AI-Generated
        Icons: Due to the nature of the IconizeAI Service, which involves the
        generation of icons using artificial intelligence, we do not offer
        refunds based on the quality or subjective preferences of the generated
        icons. b. User Responsibility: Users are responsible for carefully
        describing their icon preferences and requirements when using the
        IconizeAI Service. Refunds will not be granted if the generated icons do
        not meet expectations based on subjective or personalized criteria. 2.
        Non-Refundable Situations: a. User Expectations: Refunds will not be
        provided if the user's expectations for the generated icons are not met.
        As AI-generated results may vary, users are encouraged to provide
        detailed and specific descriptions to improve the likelihood of desired
        outcomes. b. User Input Accuracy: Users are responsible for ensuring the
        accuracy and clarity of their input when generating icons. Refunds will
        not be issued for cases where the generated icons do not meet
        expectations due to inaccurate or unclear user input. 3. Refund
        Requests: a. Technical Issues: Refunds may be considered in the event of
        technical issues that prevent users from accessing or using the
        IconizeAI Service. b. Fraudulent Transactions: Refunds may be granted in
        cases of unauthorized or fraudulent transactions. Users are encouraged
        to report any unauthorized transactions promptly. 4. How to Request a
        Refund: Users seeking a refund under the eligible criteria must submit a

        the user's account may vary depending on the payment method and
        financial institution. 6. Policy Modification: IconizeAI reserves the
